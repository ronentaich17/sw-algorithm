# Smith Waterman Python Implementation

This program is a work-in-progress that is designed to simulate the local sequence alignment algorithm, Smith-Waterman.

When given two sequences, the portions of the respective strings most similar to one another will be found through the process of
matrix initialization, filling, and traceback. This repo is still a work-in-progress.
